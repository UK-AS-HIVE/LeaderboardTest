ServiceConnectorDemo
====================

This simple Meteor app demonstrates the possibility of using OAuth 2.0 to
connect multiple Web 2.0 services to a single account.  This effectively
authorizes the Meteor app to act as an agent on behalf of the connected
accounts.  If carefully designed, this could act as a mediator between
disparate groups to improve workflow and organizational cohesion.

For more mature examples in the same vein, see the commercial services IFTTT
and Zapier.
